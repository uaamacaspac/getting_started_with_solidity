# Getting Started with Solidity
This repository was made for a project in metacrafters where I was required to create a contract named MyToken.

## Description
My contract, MyToken, has 3 public variables that can store the name of the token, its abbreviation, and total supply. I have a mapping that gets the total balance from an address which would be used for anyone who wants to mint or burn the token. I have a constructor that instantiate the token with its name, abbreviation, and total supply. I have the mint function that adds the value from the parameter to the total supply and the person who minted the token. I also have a function that burns the token by subtracting the value from the parameter to the total supply and the person who burned the token.

### Getting Started
I did not install anytime as I was using remix.

#### Compile
The first step to use the contract would be to compile it. After that, it will be available in the Deploy & Run Transactions Tab.

#### Deploy
You can deploy the contract by selecting the deploy button which will deploy the contract with a gas fee using the address given to you.

#### Run
You can run the contract with its function under the Deployed Contracts in the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
